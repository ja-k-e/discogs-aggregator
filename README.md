## Requirements

- node js
- postgres
- modern browser

## Setup

- `yarn install`
- `createdb discogs_collections` we are using postgres.
- `touch secrets.json` then update it with your db connection settings and (optional) Discogs API token.
  - Providing a Discogs API `userToken` ups rate limiting from 25 per minute to 60, practically preventing you from hitting a rate limit.
  - `discogs: { consumerKey: '...', consumerSecret: '...' }` will also work if you have them, but a `userToken` is more than enough.

```json
{
  "database": {
    "user": "<DB_USER>",
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "discogs_collections",
    "password": "",
    "port": 5432
  },
  "discogs": {
    "userToken": "<OPTIONAL_API_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

- `yarn setup` to initialize the database. This runs `structure.sql`.
  - Calling this again will delete all of your data. Be careful.
- Update `usernames.json` to be an array of usernames you want to scrape.
- `yarn populate` populates the db with the Collections for the usernames in `usernames.json`. You can also do this and more from [the Client](#Client) at `/serve`.

## DB Structure

This uses four primary tables that contain all the data.

- **collections**: username and collection size
- **releases**: discogs id, title, year, formats (jsonb)
- **artists**: discogs id, name
- **labels**: discogs id, name

It has three join tables linking releases to different tables.

- **collection_releases** collection has many releases
- **artist_releases** artist has and belongs to many releases
- **label_releases** label has and belongs to many releases

It has two materialized views that aggregate some data.

- **expanded_releases** all release metadata (including artists) in a queryable interface.
- **collection_artists** a link between a collection and artist.

## DB Interface

To find out the most collected artists between the users you have scraped, you would query something like this:

```sql
SELECT max(a.name) AS artist,
  sum(r.occurrences) AS occurrences
  FROM (
    SELECT release_id,
        count(*) AS occurrences
      FROM collection_releases
     GROUP BY release_id
  ) r
  LEFT JOIN artist_releases ar ON ar.release_id = r.release_id
  LEFT JOIN artists a ON a.id = ar.artist_id
 GROUP BY a.id
 ORDER BY sum(r.occurrences) DESC;
```

Which would yield something along the lines of:

| artist        | occurrences |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Various       | 438         |
| Bj√∂rk         | 296         |
| Radiohead     | 161         |
| Miles Davis   | 153         |
| St. Vincent   | 152         |
| The Beatles   | 138         |
| David Bowie   | 127         |
| The National  | 98          |
| John Coltrane | 88          |
| Bob Dylan     | 82          |

## Client

After populating your database, you can start the client with `yarn serve`.
Then visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). From here you can search for Collections, Artists, or Labels.

![/browser](assets/browser.png?raw=true "Home Page")

Clicking an Artist name will take you to the Artist page which contains all Releases in the database for that Artist as well as data for which Artists are most often collected with that Artist.

![/artist](assets/artist.png?raw=true "Artist Page")

Clicking a Release name will take you to the Release page which contains Release metadata as well as data for which Releases are most often collected with that Release.

![/release](assets/release.png?raw=true "Release Page")

The server page (`/server`) allows you to add or update Discogs Collections to or in your database via the client. You can queue existing Collections or enter in newline-separated Discogs usernames.

![/server-interface](assets/server-interface.png?raw=true "Server Interface")

Once you've queued the usernames, run the scraper.
